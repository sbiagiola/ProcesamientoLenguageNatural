        "\n",
        "No obstante, en dominios más técnicos o con textos breves (como *hardware* o *windows*), se observa una menor correspondencia entre las clases, indicando que la representación basada únicamente en frecuencia léxica **no logra modelar adecuadamente el contexto ni la semántica subyacente**.\n",
        "\n",
        "En síntesis:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Las **clases con vocabulario característico** tienden a formar agrupamientos coherentes.  \n",
        "- Las **clases técnicas o con escaso contenido léxico** presentan similitudes espurias por coincidencias superficiales de palabras.  \n",
        "- La representación por **CountVectorizer** resulta adecuada para tareas de agrupamiento o comparación temática básica, pero presenta **limitaciones semánticas** frente a métodos más avanzados (por ejemplo, TF-IDF o embeddings contextuales).\n",

        "En conjunto, los resultados son **consistentes con la naturaleza del corpus y el tipo de vectorización empleada**, mostrando que el enfoque captura patrones léxicos relevantes, aunque carece de comprensión semántica profunda.\n"
